## Introduction

Current music streaming platforms often exploit musicians by taking a significant cut of their earnings while relying on opaque recommendation systems that favor mainstream hits over diverse voices. This results in **underpaid musicians** and **disillusioned fans**.

**Sonorus** tackles this dual challengeâ€”**discovery** and **distribution**â€”by empowering both listeners and artists with innovative incentive mechanisms designed to reward engagement and promote emerging talent.

## Our Solution

Sonorus introduces **two incentive models** to reward users for discovering and promoting music. The platform adopts an **Ã -la-carte pricing model**, where music is sold at a **per-unit price**, ensuring transparency and fairness. To prevent misuse, only users who have paid for a song can share in the streaming revenue it generates.

### Promote-to-Earn: Supporting Emerging Talent

This mechanism rewards early listeners who identify and support promising tracks. Fans can explore curated **Sonorus playlists**, pay to unlock songs, and start earning rewards.

- Starting the next day, these early adopters become eligible to share **30% of the daily streaming revenue** generated by the song alongside other paid listeners.
- The earlier they join, the sooner they start earning, shifting attention from popular tracks to **emerging talent**.

### Promote-to-Earn: Amplifying Reach

Users are incentivized to **share their favorite songs** with their network, helping expand the song's reach and recognition. By actively promoting music, fans contribute to a song's success and are rewarded for their efforts.

At Sonorus, we believe that the **power to decide what trends** should belong to the **community, not algorithms**. Discovering new music is often driven by **friends' playlists**â€”an effort that goes unrewarded on traditional platforms. Sonorus changes this dynamic, ensuring that both fans and creators receive fair recognition and compensation.
