## Introduction

**Participatory Budgeting (PB)** and **Participatory Design (PD)** are transformative approaches that foster collaboration and accountability among governments, communities, and experts. These frameworks empower citizens to:
- **Propose ideas**
- **Vote on priorities**
- **Monitor implementation stages**

By utilizing structured stages‚Äî**proposal submission**, **expert vetting**, **community voting**, and **implementation monitoring**‚ÄîPB and PD create a transparent, inclusive, and democratic decision-making process. These methods ensure public projects reflect real community needs and priorities.

## Pain Points

1. **Limited Community Involvement**:
  Traditional decision-making processes often exclude direct community input, resulting in projects misaligned with local priorities.

2. **Lack of Transparency**:
  Stakeholders frequently remain uninformed about project progress, budgets, and outcomes.

3. **Inefficient Resource Allocation**:
  Without community-driven insights, resources may be allocated to low-impact or unpopular projects.

4. **Difficulty in Sustaining Engagement**:
  Citizens lose interest without continuous updates or mechanisms to influence outcomes at various stages.

## Solution

Co-City addresses these challenges through a **user-centric participatory framework** comprising:

1. **Proposal Stage**:
  Citizens propose ideas, upvote suggestions, and collaborate to refine project designs.

2. **Expert Vetting**:
  Specialists assess feasibility, allocate budgets, and set timelines for community-approved proposals.

3. **Community Voting**:
  Transparent and inclusive voting methods (**rank-based and ELO-based**) ensure fairness and widespread participation.

4. **Implementation and Monitoring**:
  Real-time updates keep communities informed about project progress, expenditures, and challenges, ensuring accountability.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Proposal Submission**:
 Users can propose projects, engage in Reddit-style discussions, and upvote promising ideas to boost visibility.

- **Expert Support and Vetting**:
 Designers and specialists guide initiators to strengthen proposals, allocate budgets, and determine feasibility.

- **Diverse Voting Methods**:
 Robust systems like **rank-based** and **ELO-based voting** ensure democratic project prioritization.

- **Real-Time Progress Updates**:
 Governments provide continuous updates on project timelines, budgets, and implementation stages.

- **Community Monitoring Tools**:
 Citizens actively monitor project execution, maintaining transparency and accountability.

This structured approach bridges the gap between governance and community participation, ensuring public projects are impactful, inclusive, and transparent.
