## Introduction

In 2022, I founded **China's first podcast focusing on women's sports**, offering a unique perspective that goes beyond traditional sports coverage. Our goal was to explore women's experiences in sports and the broader social issues surrounding them. We interviewed Olympic medalists on their postpartum comeback journeys, discussed with lesser-known gymnasts the balance between athletic achievement and respecting children's rights, and spoke with female NBA journalists about systemic discrimination in the industry. Beyond sports professionals, we also explored stories from the periphery, such as how wives and children of athletes navigate the influencer era, where attention economies perpetuate modern class divisions.

Over two years, Sport Herstory was featured three times on the homepage of Xiaoyuzhou （小宇宙）, China's largest podcast platform. These highlights included episodes delving into evolving narratives around female sports icons, public discourse on polarizing figures like Gu Ailing, and the sociocultural implications of athlete families turning to social media for relevance and influence.
